# Axon Retail Cars Analysis

# Problem Statement

### Overview
Axon, a small classic car retailer, faces challenges in managing and analyzing their sales data. Their sales team lacks a centralized system for data management and analysis, leading to difficulties in understanding the data and obtaining accurate and up-to-date sales reports. To address these issues, Axon has initiated a project aimed at implementing a Business Intelligence (BI) solution using Microsoft PowerBI and SQL.

### Project Objectives
The goal of the project is to design and implement a BI solution that enables Axon to efficiently manage and analyze their sales data. Key objectives include:

1. **Data Integration:** Import and integrate data from the MySQL database into PowerBI.
2. **Data Preparation:** Clean and transform the data to ensure its readiness for analysis.
3. **Interactive Dashboards:** Develop interactive dashboards and reports using PowerBI to assist the sales team and management in interpreting the data.
4. **Advanced Analytics:** Utilize SQL for advanced analytics to extract insights that can improve sales.
5. **Real-time Access:** Enable real-time access to dashboards and reports for informed, data-driven decisions.

The success of the project will be determined by the effectiveness of the BI solution in enhancing data management and decision-making at Axon.

## Project Implementation

### Steps to Solve the Capstone Project

1. **Data Source:** Utilize the provided MySQL database as the data source. Create a new database named 'classicmodels' in MySQL using the provided link.

2. **Data Extraction and Cleaning:** Extract data from the designated sources and perform data cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.

3. **Data Loading:** Load the cleaned data into PowerBI using appropriate features. Document all data loading and transformation steps clearly.

4. **Data Modeling:** Create a data model within PowerBI, establishing relationships between tables and optimizing data structure for analysis.

4. **Dashboard Design:** Design interactive dashboards and reports in PowerBI, incorporating charts, graphs, and tables to visualize data. Utilize DAX functions for data analysis.

5. **Advanced Analytics:** Use SQL for advanced analytics, including pivot tables, queries, and views, to extract valuable insights from sales data.

6. **Testing and Debugging:** Test and debug the BI solution to ensure it functions as expected. Address any issues that arise during testing.

7. **Deployment:** Deploy the BI solution, including dashboards, reports, and advanced analytics, for use by the sales team and management.

### Database Description

The MySQL sample database schema includes eight tables:

1. Customers
2. Products
3. ProductLines
4. Orders
5. OrderDetails
6. Payments
7. Employees
8. Offices

These tables contain typical business data related to customers, products, sales orders, payments, employees, and offices.
