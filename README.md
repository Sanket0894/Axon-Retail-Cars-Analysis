# Axon Retail Cars Analysis

## Problem Statement

### Overview
In this project, I tackled a critical challenge faced by Axon, a classic car retailer. Axon's sales team struggled with managing and making sense of their sales data due to a lack of a centralized system. The absence of accurate and up-to-date sales reports hindered effective decision-making.

To address these issues, I try to implement a robust Business Intelligence (BI) solution using Microsoft PowerBI and SQL.

### Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were:

1. **Data Integration:** Import and integrate data from the MySQL database into PowerBI.
2. **Data Preparation:** Clean and transform the data to ensure its readiness for analysis.
3. **Data Modeling:** Create a data model within PowerBI to establish relationships between different data tables and optimize data retrieval for analysis.
4. **Interactive Dashboards:** Develop interactive dashboards and reports using PowerBI to assist the sales team and management in interpreting the data.
5. **Advanced Analytics:** Utilize SQL for advanced analytics to extract insights that can improve sales.
6. **Real-time Access:** Enable real-time access to dashboards and reports for informed, data-driven decisions.

The success of the project was measured by the effectiveness of the BI solution in enhancing data management and decision-making at Axon.

## Project Implementation

### Steps to Solve the Capstone Project

1. **Data Source:** I leveraged a provided MySQL database as the data source and created a new database named 'classicmodels' in MySQL using the provided [link]((https://www.mysqltutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mysqlsampledatabase.zip)).

2. **Data Extraction and Cleaning:** Extracting data from the designated sources, I performed data cleaning tasks, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.

3. **Data Modeling:** To optimize data structure for analysis, I created a data model within PowerBI, establishing relationships between tables.

4. **Data Loading:** The cleaned and modeled data was loaded into PowerBI using appropriate features, and I meticulously documented all data loading and transformation steps.

5. **Dashboard Design:** Crafting interactive dashboards and reports in PowerBI was a key part of the project. I incorporated charts, graphs, and tables to visualize data and used DAX functions for data analysis.

6. **Advanced Analytics:** To extract valuable insights from sales data, I used SQL for advanced analytics, performing tasks such as pivot tables, queries, and views.

7. **Testing and Debugging:** Testing and debugging were carried out to ensure the BI solution functioned as expected. Any issues that arose during testing were promptly addressed.

8. **Deployment:** Finally, I deployed the BI solution, including dashboards, reports, and advanced analytics, making sure it was user-friendly and easily adopted by the sales team and management.

### Database Description

The MySQL sample database schema comprised eight tables:

1. Customers
2. Products
3. ProductLines
4. Orders
5. OrderDetails
6. Payments
7. Employees
8. Offices


### Tools Required

To successfully complete the Capstone project, I employed the following tools and technologies:

- [Microsoft PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/): Utilized for data visualization, data modeling, and dashboard creation.
- [SQL](https://www.mysql.com/): Employed for data extraction, transformation, and advanced analytics.
